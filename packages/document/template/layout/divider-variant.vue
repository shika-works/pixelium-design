	When designing an accounting package, the programmer operates as a mediator between people having different ideas:
	<px-divider></px-divider>
	how it must operate,
	<px-divider variant="double"></px-divider>
	how its reports must appear,
	<px-divider variant="dashed"></px-divider>
	and how it must conform to the tax laws.
	<px-divider variant="dotted"></px-divider>
	By contrast, an operating system is not limited my outside appearances.
	<px-divider variant="ridge"></px-divider>
	When designing an operating system, the programmer seeks the simplest harmony between machine and ideas.
	<px-divider variant="groove"></px-divider>
	This is why an operating system is easier to design.
