		The most important part of writing a program is not deciding what data structures to use or
		what algorithms to implement. It is understanding the problem. Once you really understand
		the problem, the right data structures and algorithms often become obvious. The hard part is
		getting to that point—seeing past the surface and figuring out what the program really needs
		to do.
