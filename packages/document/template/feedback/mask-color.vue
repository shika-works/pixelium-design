		The programming project is a tar pit. No matter how carefully one plans, no matter how
		carefully one designs, no matter how carefully one codes, the project seems inevitably to
		slip. The schedule stretches, the budget expands, the team grows, and still the end recedes.
		The tar pit is not merely a matter of poor management or inadequate tools; it is inherent in
		the nature of software itself. Software is invisible, unvisualizable, and therefore
		unmanageable. It is complex, with innumerable states and paths, each a potential source of
		error. It is changeable, subject to whims of users and marketers. And it is unforgiving; a
		single misplaced comma can bring the whole system crashing down. Thus the programmer, like
		the prehistoric beast, struggles deeper into the tar with every movement.
