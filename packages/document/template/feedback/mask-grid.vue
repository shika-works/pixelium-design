		There is no single development, in either technology or management technique, which by
		itself promises even one order-of-magnitude improvement in productivity, in reliability, in
		simplicity. We cannot expect ever to see two programmers producing ten times as much useful
		software as two others. The hard part of building software is the specification, the design,
		and the testing of the conceptual construct, not the labor of coding or testing. This is the
		essence of the 'No Silver Bullet' argument. The complexity, conformity, changeability, and
		invisibility of software make it inherently difficult to build. We can make incremental
		improvements, but there will be no magical breakthrough that makes software development
		easy. The difficulties are fundamental, not incidental.
