		Good programmers are always learning. They read books, attend conferences, and talk to
		others. They experiment with new languages and tools, constantly trying to write better
		code. Studying classic problems teaches how to break them down and balance trade-offs—time
		versus space, simplicity versus efficiency. Reading others' code reveals structure, naming,
		and commenting habits. Learning never stops; every line is a chance to improve.
